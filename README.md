##     Motivation and Features

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.
What makes your project stand out?



##     Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from pytoon import some, stuff

place_holder_for(making_something_cool)
```

### Full Documentation

After cloning, point your browser to the file `docs/index.html`.  See also the `samples/` directory.



##     Installation

Aside from cloning this and making sure the project directory is in your Python search path, just hang on while I pip-ify it (today = 30.Oct.2020).
So far this has only been tested for python>=3.7 on *nix systems (specifically Linux/Mac).

### Dependencies

If you only want to render to svg, then none.  If you want to output to jpg or pdf (static images only), then ImageMagick and Inkscape will need to be available in the environment.

### Testing

### Support

Email tonydutoi@gmail.com, and I'll do what I can.



##     Development

### Known issues and bugs

Nothing now

### Roadmap

List of desired features

### Contributing

In theory, I welcome collaboration.
In practice, you will have to be very self-sufficient and patient, as this is an intermittent side project.
But I'm still to picky to release much control of it yet.
If this project catches your interest, and you can work like that, great!
