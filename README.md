# PyToon

PyToon is a python-based utility for making line-art animations and drawings.

## Installation

Aside from cloning this and putting it in your python path, just hang on while I pip-ify it (today = 30.Oct.2020).
So far this has only been tested for python >=3.7 on *nix systems (specifically Linux/Mac).

### Dependencies

If you only want to render to svg, then none.  If you want to output to jpg or pdf (static images only), then ImageMagick and Inkscape will need to be available in the environment.

## Usage

```python
from pytoon import some, stuff

place_holder_for(making_something_cool)
```

## Contributing

In theory, I welcome collaboration.
In practice, you will have to be very self-sufficient and patient, as this is an intermittent side project.
If this project catches your interest, and you can work like that, great!
