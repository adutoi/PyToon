    "Consider a grid of square cells in 2D.  We will assume that the dimensions of these cells is much smaller than any length scale that we care about (taken to be infinitesemal eventually).  We will assert that the areas of these cells shall be constant even as they are subjected to rectangular distortions.  In particular, let there be a function $f$ of the horizontal coordinate $x$ which scales the cells in the y direction (so the horizontal boundaries of adjacent columns will no longer align).  In other words, for the $i^\\text{th}$ column (and $j^\\text{th}$ row), we have the following transformations (prime does not mean derivative)\n",
